              <div class="teamList__text">
                <p>Florence has always been passionate about nutrition and training, but it was not until she lived in Sao Paulo, Brazil that she started her fitness journey. She spent the first years believing that running for hours each day was the best way to reach her fitness goals, but was then introduced to Crossfit and strength training, which changed her training style forever. Today she loves lifting heavy and seeks on becoming stronger and stronger.</p>
                <p>After completing her Communication and Marketing Bachelor's degree at the University of Montreal, she worked in the communications field for a couple of years before she decided to pursue her passion and began working as a personal trainer and nutrition consultant in a private facility specialized in weight loss and strength/conditioning training.</p>
                <p>Flo enjoys helping others get the results they deserve in the healthiest and most sustainable way possible while enjoying life. Get to know her better on IG @florsylvestrefit</p>

He previously worked at Equinox climbing the ranks to a Tier 3+ trainer and top 150 in sessions. He believes strongly in behavior change principles as a cornerstone to his methodology. This passion in not only bettering the body but also the mind led Equinox to have him lead in mentoring new trainers as they were hired. Guiding them through the trials and hardships of being not only successful in business, but to find their inner passion to change and enhance the lives of the people they work with for the better. </p>

              <div class="teamList__text">
                <p>Since 2009 I have worked as a personal trainer/strength and conditioning coach. I have coached 542 people to date, with ages ranging from 14-73 years old. These were of varied populations, including the military, Olympic athletes, and regular working professionals. I served in the United States Navy for 6 years and proceeded to acquire a degree in Biological Anthropology from UCLA.</p>
                <p>I will be starting my MS program in Exercise and Nutrition Sciences in the fall with George Washington University. This program is taught from a two-perspective approach. First, it looks at strength and conditioning in relation to human performance. Secondly, it looks at strength and conditioning in relation to health outcomes regarding the general population.  </p>
                <p>I am at the end of rigorous mentorship with Chris Beardsley, who is a leading expert in research literature  in relation to strength and conditioning, biomechanics, exercise physiology, and physical therapy and rehabilitation. I am a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) through the NSCA. With a failure rate of 52%, this credential is considered the gold standard for training certifications and is commonly required for head trainers of professional sports teams. I am recognized as an Olympic weightlifting coach by the United States Olympic Committee and have assisted in the coaching of an national trial’s qualifier. I have worked with Division 1 national championship athletes. Additionally, as a qualified Precision Nutrition Coach, I am able to integrate nutrition and recovery practices with strength training.</p>
